            <p>Step into another world on the island of Socotra — a true natural wonder where more than 800 plant species thrive, and nearly a third of them grow nowhere else on Earth.</p>

            <p>Walk beneath the legendary Dragon’s Blood Trees (Dracaena cinnabari), some of the island’s oldest and most iconic guardians. Their wide, umbrella-shaped crowns create otherworldly shadows across the rocky plateaus. For centuries, locals have harvested their deep red resin — known as "dragon’s blood" — to use as medicine, dye, and even in ancient rituals. These trees aren’t just strange and beautiful; they are living symbols of the island’s timeless magic.</p>

            <p>Marvel at the Desert Rose (Adenium obesum socotranum), a plant that looks like it belongs on another planet. Its thick, swollen trunk stores precious water during long dry seasons, while its brilliant pink blossoms burst into life against the barren landscape. Sculptural and striking, the Desert Rose shows how life can find a way even in the harshest places.</p>

            <p>Lose yourself among the ancient Frankincense Trees (Boswellia socotrana), their gnarled trunks twisting dramatically out of rocky cliffs and dry riverbeds. Once upon a time, their sweet-smelling resin was more valuable than gold, carried by camel caravans across deserts to royal courts and sacred temples. Even today, their scent fills the air, linking the island to a time when Socotra was a crossroads of ancient trade routes.</p>

            <p>And beyond these wonders, Socotra hides hundreds of other strange and beautiful plants — from the spiny Cucumber Trees (Dendrosicyos socotranus), the world’s only tree-like cucumber, to tiny succulents that cling to cliffs and bloom in bursts of color after the rare rains.</p>

            <p>But Socotra’s plants are not just beautiful. They are the heart of the island’s fragile ecosystem, sheltering rare animals, protecting the soil, and preserving a balance that has lasted for millions of years. Every step across this wild land is a step through Earth's ancient story — a glimpse of what our world looked like long before cities and machines.</p>

            <p>Come explore Socotra — where nature’s imagination runs wild, and every corner hides a new, unforgettable secret.</p>
